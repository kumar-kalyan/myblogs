# Let's  crack  the block chain together

Over the whole of 2022, I heard about the term blockchain, web3, crypto, etc and so on and I was like sleeping while the whole world was making millions of dollars through. I have tried exploring it a few times but unfortunately, my procrastination defeated me in becoming a millionaire blockchain developer.

The day I'm producing content I explored a lot of topics and looked around the use cases of blockchain. I find this technology is our future and everyone must be aware of it. As you all know that I'm a genius at breaking down content like a piece of cake so I have decided to start a new series on blockchain and believe me I am on a mission to bring awareness to blockchain technology.

In this series, I will cover every single topic which will help you to become a millionaire blockchain developer for free and all I need is some support from you guys to help me stay consistent on my mission to educate the blockchain community.

I'm not a pro-level blockchain developer but you guys can trust me and can learn along with me from scratch. Together we will explore all the libraries, SDKs and even the deployment, and I promise the content will be authentic and easy to understand. I am planning to start with Ethereum as it is the most popular having a huge community base and followed by other blockchain technologies like polygon, Cello, flow, deso, Solana and a lot more.

My article will contain everything starting from how-to guides, tutorials, software comparisons, blockchain automation tools and every single thing that you can't imagine.
