## What is System Design

System design ‚öôÔ∏è is the process of designing the architecture, components, interfaces, and data for a particular system to meet specific requirements.

Before building any application or system, üèóÔ∏è it is important to plan how the system will work, what resources will be needed, where to deploy it, which APIs the system components will use, and how to scale the system. Therefore, system design concepts are very important for software developers to master to build efficient and scalable systems. üíØ
